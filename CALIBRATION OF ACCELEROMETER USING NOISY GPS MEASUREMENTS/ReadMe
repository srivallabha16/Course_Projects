MATLAB PROJECT

CALIBRATION OF ACCELEROMETER USING NOISY GPS MEASUREMENTS

• Applied Kalman filter in MATLAB to estimate position & velocity. Estimated instrument bias without its measurement
• Achieved error mostly within 1 sigma bound. Verified with Monte Carlo simulation. Tested for orthogonality of error in estimate
